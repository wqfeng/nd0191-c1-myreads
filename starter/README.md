It's the first project for Udacity's React Nanodegree. It display your books on shelfs and you can change the status of each book as you wish. You can also serch from the database. I learned a few things from this project.

- How to split a page into multiple React Components. It's not only for code reuse, but also make th code easier to manage.
- How to use React-Router to manage routes for a react app.
- Replace class components with Hooks. The code looks more concise.
- Use `Prop-Types` to document a component.
